Viewsources Podcast is another podcast about front-end development and web design. We talk about the web, industry news, workflows and important topics about development.

There are so many great front-end podcasts out there. Why did we need another one? It's not so much the larger listening audience needed another podcast, we did. We're all passionate about what we talk about in each episode, even if they weren't recorded we'd still find ourselves in these conversations just as often.

In most episodes we go through their carefully curated collection of web development news and links to discuss various trends and ideologies that are circulating throughout the industry. We then dive into a formal topic for a formal discussion.
